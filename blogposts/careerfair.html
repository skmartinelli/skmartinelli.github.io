       <p> 
       Going to a career fair tomorrow. Finished my first website at my new job today. Not a lot going on for me. Just wanted to leave an update. <br><br>

       I'm not a huge fan of career fairs (gasp). They feel pretty fruitless for me. Frankly, most of my job search has been pretty fruitless, but maybe tomorrow will be different. Last week I went to a virtual career fair and it was ok. I still need to apply to most of the job openings I saw on there, but I had a few good conversations. I found that the conversations went better when I was asking for advice than about what the job was like. Idk. <br><br>

       I finished (mostly) my first website for my new job. we'll see if the client has feedback and if so then ill be back working on it (i imagine they will, but perhaps not. i think it looks pretty good) It's wordpress using elementor, so it's all wysiwyg stuff, but I'm learning pretty well I think. It feels like one of those funny things where the skill floor is really low and easy to grasp, but in some ways I'm more of a noob with it than I am with just typing what I want into an editor. But I enjoy it quite a bit more. My boss is great, he's nice and communicative. I'm still nervous because it's my first white collar type, professional job, so I'm learning the ropes about replying to emails and stuff like that. It's good experience. I enjoy it. I hope I can do it for a long time. It's good work, building websites for my local community. It feels good. <br><br>

       Probably the most fun thing this week was I signed up for the unlimited sips club at Panera Bread. Catch me at your local Panera sipping on some different teas and coffees. <br><br>

       It feels like every other week I have to relearn this, but comparison is such a horrible horrible thing. It's so silly, this website. Because to me, it is horrible and the peak of my embarrassment. I see how it is so poorly and shoddily built. How it is stupidly lightweight and lacking in finesse or design. How it is static and built using a beginner's tools and handiwork. But my girlfriend showed it to her friends today and they went "omg! he has a website??? that's so cool!!" and it's just strange how. to me this website is just ok. it's functional. im happy to have a place to host my professional life and some thoughts i have sometimes. but to others its like. whaaat? he has a website?? woaaooaoww. my girlfriend they liked it. i said it wasn't cool, but she said it was to "normal people" and that made me laugh :) <br><br>

       Realizing now i mostly lost this week to video games, lol. It's the last week of the season for season 1 of Diablo 4, so I wanted to finish up the battle pass and get my druid to level 100 (i made it to 71 before I tapped out), and then two days ago the new Forza Motorsport came out and i have been EATING THAT UPPP!!! oh man, i was feeling a little blue writing most of this blog, but writing about forza makes me giddy. get me behind the wheel i want to race. it's such a terrific game. its a bit difficult because i like to play with a lot of the assists turned off (in my head if i turn on the assists it feels too arcadey. and if i win i feel like i didn't earn it. but when i lost i feel like the assists slowed me down) <br><br>

       i had a conversation with my friend kirby about how like. everyone just complains about video games. just have fun guys. everyone goes "ohhh forza horizon 5 sucks. there's nothing to do." like girl what are you talking about. that game is a SANDBOX you can do so many things. its like people need numbers to go up to have fun. if ur having fun, play it, if youre not, Make it fun or if you cant just play something else. idk. maybe im just getting old <br><br>

       anyway. that's all i got.
