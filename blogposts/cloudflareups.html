        ive had this dreadful feeling lately that the things that I like never seem to stick around. this feeling tends most often to be a fear more than a reality (I fear that my favorite pho restaurant and boba place will shut down one day. i have no real control over this scenario other than the knowledge it will one day happen), but some things that i like have indeed left sooner than i would have liked. titanfall 2 servers don't work, there was a weinerschnitzel as a kid i loved that was close to my house which is now a bar and grill, and club penguin's ice has melted. it's all pretty trivial in the long run. anyway, this month google domains shut down, which had hosted the sammartinelli.com domain for a couple years now. this is what prompted this blog post.<br><br>
        
        i have after a couple days and a couple headaches finally completed the transfer to cloudflare. it took me a while, and frankly this post is mostly a test to see how easy (or difficult) it is to push updates and changes. hopefully everything is easy, and then i will learn lots of new skills because cloudflare will make it easier and i can learn lots. however, im expecting that it'll be a headache ;-; what can i do. anyway. at the very least, cloudflare is 2 bucks cheaper a year for the domain than google domains, so that's pretty cool. <br><br>

        i love chatgpt. it helped me figure out some problems that i had when transferring. what a neat thing that is. anyway. gonna push this to git now hopefully that is the end of this post and it'll be uploaded so easy and no headaches. <br><br>

        update: everything was super easy and pushing the changes to the github repo automatically pushed it to the main website. perfect and thank you cloudflare. see u all next week
