    <p> and lots more thats just what i can think of now. Maybe one day i may look back and go "oh wow how naive." I may have secured part time employment so that is awesome and exciting! very excited to get to develop things for people other than myself! but in the meantime its project city baby</p>
    <p> catch u on the flip side. hope ur having fun out there everyone, because that's what really matters. comparison is the thief of joy</p>

        post blog thoughts: measuring myself in what i lack instead of what i know may contribute to bad mental patterns. i know lots of things. i am having a lot of fun
