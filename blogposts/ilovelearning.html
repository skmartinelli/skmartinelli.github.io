       <p> 
       I am very passionate about learning and freely sharing information. I think information behind a paywall in the current era is unforgiveable. I think it should be the responsibility of those with knowledge to share it to as many people as possible and make it as accessible as possible. (I hate paying for textbooks and courses.) Because of this I am creating my own little moocs index section where i can keep moocs and maybe it will be helpful to someone else. it will be filled with all kinds of resources! 
       <br><br>
       
       a mooc (massive open online course) 

       anyway. this is because i wanted to learn google cloud tech but it was gated behind a paywall. now i wanna learn deep learning but i dont wanna pay. that's all just wanted to share and update my landing page
    <br><br>


    maybe one day i will build a nice little repo of moocs and i can share it with the world. i think it'd be best if its mostly cs stuff for now. anyway. thats all. short blog post today just wanted to share that i want to share. toodles
