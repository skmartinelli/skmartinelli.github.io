       <p> 
        just started this blog. wanted to make this website more active. more than just my professional website environment. dunno. just bored i guess! <br><br>
        I've been using obsidian to write my notes lately. I used to really bash on people that used so-called "second brain" systems (I was a devout tiago forte hater. I had no reason to believe this other than spite) but now that ive been using obsidian for a while i think its really cool. I'm sorry Tiago for the one sided (and unheard and unspoken) hatred i held in my heart.<br><br> 

        the reason ive been super into obsidian (and part of the reason im a bit emboldened to use this website more instead of just using it as a professional portal to my portfolio and resume and whatnot) is because obsidian uses markdown stored LOCALLY! I thought that was so cool. I've become so used to having websites and companies own what i create so i thought it was novel that obsidian lets me contain my own notes on my devices. Ironically im using icloud as a cloud storage solution so ive kinda thrown the main benefit out the window. but its the easiest solution for my usecase and i like apple. lame! but it's the easiest free way at the moment for me to access my notes on myphone and laptop. swell swell swell <br><br>

        im still trying to figure out more uses for it... right now it's mostly been a way to keep notes on lectures and podcasts and books. sometimes i keep little notes on topics of interests or do mini word dumps on it. <br><br>

        obsidian is quickly becoming my favorite notes platform because of the linking feature. obsidian allows you to create <a href="pranked.html"> links</a> within your notes to other notes, which helps me to connect my ideas and quickly traverse without having to remember what i need to search for. I can go to the topic im thinking of and quickly move between the nodes. There is a huge graph of all my ideas and notes i create. it's swell.<br><br>

        its helping me to learn more after college. it makes it more fun and interesting. Lately i havent been learning anything marketable... lots of chomsky and yuval harari and mental health things... but i'd like to use it to help me become a better developer. ie, learning backend tech stack stuff, so maybe i could implement a comments system on here or something. right now if you wanted to comment on here you'd have to <a href="mailto:skmartinelli@outlook.com"> email me </a> or something. it isn't ideal right now. lol <br><br>

        anyway. that's all i have. been playing a lot of video games and reading sometimes. need to watch the new ahsoka star wars show still. my brother says its good. thanks for reading i just wanted to get my words out <br><br>


        sam todo list for sammartinelli.com: add comments? get off github pages? add css for the blog posts? who cares. its mostly for ME! anyway below is my current graph on obsidian aint it pretty <br><br>
