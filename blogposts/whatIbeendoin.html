        Got a part time job doing web dev :) Haven't done any work work yet but excited to get started once my boss lets me know if he has a client. Hit legend rank in hearthstone. Listening to lots of podcasts (mostly lex fridman). I am learning wordpress and elementor but i want to code code. but i know not what to code. I want to be like one of those smart kids. i dont know how they get started but i'll get started one day. gonna try to make my own wordpress website using google cloud. dont know the costs at the moment. might not be worthwhile...

            Dunno. Read a really cool blog post about indie hacking. I want to look into it. See if i can hack it in the indie hacking space. I can make things. I know I can!!! I want to finish a book! So many things to do! I love life :) I have all the time in the world. Many people don't enter the tech industry until their late twenties. Everyone say it with me:

            <b> imitation is the thief of joy.</b>

            <p> been thinking whats the point of sammartinelli.com and i think i just want something to last beyond me. a word dump someone may find someday and think. huh. so thats what sam martinelli is like. i think right now that a github pages site would outlast other platforms like instagram or facebook or whatever. but who knows. maybe a block chain lol. crypto. cryptography is so confusing tho. too many things to learn (fun sam fact: intro to cryptography was the first and only class i withdrew from at ucsd! i had this french professor and i thought that i Understood the material but then the exam came and i DID NOT! crypto is so crazy but so cool. i wish i could've wrapped my head around it. maybe another day.)</p><br><br>

            <p> anyway here are some other things ive been thinking about: i don't think i believe in intellectual property (piracy is so easy and can one day be so automated. i think the system of media creation and exclusivity will come to an end if the general social opinion changes. but it is so strange! who will pay for it? idk. not smart enough to think that far ahead. i just think its neat. i was listening to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buarAx_u2qg&t=1538s"> lex fridman </a>podcast episode about free speech and he mentioned the printing press and how that enabled martin luther to get his ideas out. and i went: hey, independently published websites are so samesies. i put my lil thoughts out there and they can be spread anywhere (but why would you do that?) anyway now im gonna go mess with google cloud bye bye </p>

    <p> i changed my mind here is one last thing i keep thinking about: <a href="http://localroger.com/k5host/casodycs.html"> A Casino Odyssey In Cyberspace</a>. Such a terrific short story. so highly recommend it if you have a spare 20 minutes and want to read a short story that will change how u view what is meaningful. I've been finding so many parallels because i spend most days now on my computer in simulated little worlds or making my own. is the simulated world meaningful enough for me ? sometimes i think it is. the alternative is so stay in the casino... anyway. go give it a read.</p><br><br>
    <p> that's all she wrote. go have a good week and eat something yummy and tell ur loved ones you appreciate them</p>
