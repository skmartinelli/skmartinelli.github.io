        the original title for this was going to be "wiggle my iggle" but without context it's a bit. its a bit much <br><br>



        wiggler nation is a tiktok account that posts mario kart gameplay of the wiggler character riding the wiggler kart. he exclaims "wiggle my iggle!" as he takes first place. he just screams a lot and has a funny evil laugh. i think it is genius and absurd. lately i've been asking myself why i would do anything at all if wiggler nation does it better. "wiggler boost" he exclaims once he gets the golden mushroom.
